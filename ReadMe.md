# EXPRESS DEV SKILLS
---

## INTRO
Now that we have started unit 2 in the Software Enginner Immersive program at GA, the focus of this deliverable is to list my dev skills.

Express is a popular unopinionated web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the 
Node.js runtime environment. 

With Express we have three capabilities:
1. The ability to define routes
2. The ability to process HTTP requests using middleware
3. The ability to use a view engine to render dynamic templates

Using the terminal to run Nodeman, I can take a look into my localhost:3000 server and view the app listing my dev skills. Also, the ability to add new skills or even remove skills using Express.
